# Abstract Shape Creator with Design Patterns 🖌️

A Java-based Abstract Shape Creator that supports **Point**, **Circle**, **Line Segment**, and **Rectangle**. This project leverages **Object-Oriented Programming** principles along with the following design patterns:
- **Iterator Pattern**: To traverse collections of shapes.
- **Singleton Pattern**: To manage a single instance of the Shape Manager.
- **Factory Pattern**: To create instances of shapes dynamically.

## ✨ Features
- **Four Geometric Shapes**:
  - **Point**
  - **Circle**
  - **Line Segment**
  - **Rectangle**
- **Design Patterns**:
  - **Iterator**: Efficiently navigate through a collection of shapes.
  - **Singleton**: Manage a single instance of the Shape Manager.
  - **Factory**: Dynamically create shapes based on user input or configuration.
- **Collision Detection**:
  - Each shape implements a `CollisionDetector` interface to check for strict intersections.
- **Extensibility**:
  - Modular design to add new shapes and behaviors with minimal changes.

## 🚀 Requirements
- **JDK**: Java Development Kit 11 or higher.
- **Gradle**: Gradle 6 or higher (optional for build automation).
